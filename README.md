## üèãÔ∏è Personalized Gym Plan Feature

The personalized gym plan feature allows users to generate custom workout plans based on their specific needs and goals.

### How It Works

1. Users fill out a comprehensive questionnaire about their:
   - Basic information (age, sex, height, weight)
   - Fitness level (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
   - Goals (weight loss, muscle gain, strength, etc.)
   - Intensity preference (low, moderate, high)
   - Time commitment (days per week, minutes per session)
   - Available equipment (gym, limited, bodyweight only)
   - Health conditions and exercise preferences

2. The system uses Google's Gemini AI to generate a personalized workout plan tailored to the user's inputs.

3. The generated plan includes:
   - A weekly schedule
   - Specific exercises for each day
   - Sets, reps, and rest periods
   - Warm-up and cool-down routines
   - Progression guidelines
   - Nutrition tips

4. Users can view their plan, create a quest from it, and track their progress.

5. All plans are saved to the user's history for future reference.
