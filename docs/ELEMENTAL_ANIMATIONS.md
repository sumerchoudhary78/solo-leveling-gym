# Elemental Animations for Avatar Frames

The Solo Leveling Gym now features dynamic elemental animations for avatar frames based on the user's rank.

## Overview

As you level up in the gym, your rank increases, and your avatar frame gains more powerful elemental effects. Each rank is associated with a specific element that represents your growing power and abilities.

## Elemental Ranks

| Rank | Level Range | Element | Description |
|------|-------------|---------|-------------|
| E | 1-9 | Shadow | Subtle, dark particles that fade in and out, representing the beginning of your journey. |
| D | 10-14 | Ice | Crystalline, shimmering particles with occasional sparkles, symbolizing precision and clarity. |
| C | 15-19 | Water | Flowing, wave-like particles that move with fluidity, representing adaptability. |
| B | 20-24 | Earth | Stable, grounded particles with gravitational effects, symbolizing strength and endurance. |
| A | 25-29 | Wind | Gusty, dynamic particles that move in bursts, representing speed and agility. |
| S | 30-39 | Fire | Flickering, rising particles with random size changes, symbolizing passion and intensity. |
| National Level | 40-49 | Lightning | Flashing, jumping particles with sudden movements, representing power and energy. |
| Special Authority | 50+ | Cosmic Energy | Complex, multi-orbital particles with pulsing effects, symbolizing mastery and transcendence. |

## Technical Details

The elemental animations are rendered using Three.js, a powerful JavaScript 3D library. Each element has unique properties:

### Shadow (E Rank)
- Particles fade in and out with erratic movement patterns
- Dark color palette with subtle variations
- Minimal animation intensity

### Ice (D Rank)
- Crystalline particles with shimmering effects
- Blue color palette with occasional sparkles
- Angular movement patterns

### Water (C Rank)
- Flowing particles with wave-like movements
- Blue-green color palette with transparency
- Smooth, continuous animations

### Earth (B Rank)
- Stable particles with gravitational effects
- Brown and amber color palette
- Slower, more deliberate movements

### Wind (A Rank)
- Dynamic particles that move in gusts
- Gray and white color palette with varying opacity
- Rapid, unpredictable movements

### Fire (S Rank)
- Flickering particles with size variations
- Red and orange color palette
- Upward movement with random intensity changes

### Lightning (National Level)
- Flashing particles with sudden position jumps
- Yellow and gold color palette
- High-contrast opacity changes

### Cosmic Energy (Special Authority)
- Complex orbital patterns with secondary movements
- Purple and violet color palette
- Multi-layered animations with pulsing effects

## Performance Considerations

The elemental animations are optimized for performance across different devices:

- Particle count scales with rank intensity
- Simplified physics calculations
- Efficient rendering techniques
- Automatic quality adjustments based on device capabilities

## Future Enhancements

In future updates, we plan to add:

- More detailed particle shapes for each element
- Interactive effects when hovering or clicking
- Sound effects tied to elemental animations
- Custom color palettes for each element
- Special combination effects for achievements
