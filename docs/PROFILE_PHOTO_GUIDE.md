# Profile Photo Upload Guide

This guide explains how to upload your profile photo in the Solo Leveling Gym application.

## Simple Direct Upload Method (Recommended)

The Simple Direct Upload method is the most reliable way to add a profile photo:

1. Go to your profile edit page by clicking "Profile" in the navigation bar or "Edit Profile" on your profile card
2. Look for the green "Simple Direct Upload" section
3. Click "Choose File" to select an image from your device
4. Click "Upload Avatar" to save your photo

This method stores your image directly in the database and works reliably across all browsers and devices.

## Image Guidelines

For best results:

- Use a square image (1:1 ratio)
- Keep the file size under 2MB for faster uploads
- Use JPG, PNG, or GIF format
- Make sure your face is clearly visible
- Use good lighting for better image quality

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Image doesn't appear after upload**
   - Try refreshing the page
   - Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+F5)
   - Try a different browser (Chrome works best)

2. **Upload button doesn't work**
   - Make sure you've selected an image first
   - Try a smaller image file
   - Check your internet connection

3. **Error messages**
   - Read the specific error message for guidance
   - Try the alternative upload methods if available
   - Contact support if problems persist

## Alternative Methods

If the Simple Direct Upload doesn't work for you, there are alternative methods available on the profile edit page:

1. **Firebase Storage Upload**: Uses Firebase Storage to store your image
2. **Direct Upload**: Uses a different approach to upload to Firebase Storage

These methods may not work in all browsers due to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issues.
